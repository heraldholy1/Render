        <p class="last-updated">MYCOIN TOKEN<br>Last Updated: December 15, 2025</p>

        <div class="intro-text">
            <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the MyCoin Token website, applications, services, documentation, and any associated digital assets, including the MyCoin Token ("Token"), operated by or on behalf of MyCoin Token ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>By accessing, using, acquiring, holding, or interacting with MyCoin Token or any related services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.</strong></p>

        <p>No assurances are made regarding scarcity, price stability, or future value.</p>

        <h2>TOKEN MIGRATION AND UPGRADE</h2>
        <p>The Token is intended to be eligible for a one-to-one (1:1) migration or upgrade to a native blockchain token at a future date, subject to technical, legal, and operational feasibility.</p>
        <p>Migration is not guaranteed and may require user action, compliance checks, or adherence to future terms.</p>
